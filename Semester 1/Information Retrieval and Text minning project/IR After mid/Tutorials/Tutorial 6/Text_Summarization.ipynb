            "French government has in the past repeatedly rejected demands to sell the Mona Lisa (pictured), but a parliamentary report has suggested it sell thousands of pieces of art to pay off national debt . Cash-strapped France could sell thousands of artworks to pay off its vast national debt, a parliamentary report has suggested. The radical plan to flog paintings and sculptures from the nation's prized collections was mooted by MPs studying ways help clear France's £150billion deficit. It comes after state-run news channel France 24 last year even suggested selling the Mona Lisa - the world's most famous painting which hangs in the Louvre museum in Paris. Now lawmakers have consulted Guillaume Cerutti, the head of Sotheby's auctioneers in France, for his opinion on the sale of publicly-owned art. He said France should move closer to a model used in the United States, where museums sometimes sell unseen parts of their collections to free up resources for the purchase of more relevant artworks. Cerutti told the BFM news channel: 'Action is needed to tackle the grotesque waste in national collections. In the Louvre alone, some 250,000 works are currently hidden away in overflow rooms. 'Museums should also be given the option of selling works that have been in public collections for at least 50 years.' It would not be the first time France has sold off treasures to prop up its finances. In 2013 the presidential Elysee Palace in Paris announced it was selling 1,000 bottles of fine wine to fund renovations. Last summer, France also said it was selling a luxury state-owned apartment on New York's 5th Avenue for around £40million. In December, the government faced accusations of treason when it announced plans to sell half of Toulouse's airport, the country's fourth largest and home of aircraft maker Airbus, to a Chinese-led consortium. The government has repeatedly rejected demands to sell Leonardo da Vinci's painting the Mona Lisa, which is often called 'priceless' but was valued at £60m in 1962 for insurance purposes. Tourists clamour to see and photograph the Mona Lisa at the Louvre museum in Paris . The Louvre (pictured) stores a vast amount of artwork and is the most visited art museum in the world .\n",

Murdered: Jamie Gao 'was in secret talks with police' before his death, according to the latest reports . Federal police have publicly denied claims that Mr Gao, who is thought to have been caught up in a Hong Kong-based Asian organised crime group, was acting as an informant when he delivered $3 million of methamphetamine to former detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara. Mr Gao had reportedly told his close friends about the hearing but the commission has denied these claims. On Saturday, it was revealed federal police were watching over murdered student Jamie Gao for a staggering three years before his death. Friends' claims that he was just a social and naturally smart pupil have been shattered by revelations that he has long been a suspected drug importer. Suggesting that he was far from simply a straight-A student at the University of Technology Sydney, federal officers have provided a 20-page document about his dealings to NSW authorities, who say Mr Gao had been a 'person of interest' since as far back as 2011. Police say that on the day of his murder Mr Gao was carrying the 3kg worth of methamphetamine. Watched: Federal police were reportedly monitoring Jamie Gao for three years before his death . 'He was not some lowly delivery boy,' one senior detective told The Daily Telegraph. 'No syndicate is going to trust some underling with 3kg of gear and you don't get trusted with that much for your first deal.' It is believed Mr Gao was caught up in organised crime group, at the same time as living an active social life and being loved-up with his new girlfriend. He still lived at home with his mother Catherin Sui Ying Gao and grandmother in a $1.5 million house in Hurstville. Police have alleged that before he was killed on Tuesday May 20, he got inside a car with  former detectives Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson and was driven to a storage unit nearby. Police claim Mr Gao was killed for his bag's contents just before 2.30pm. CCTV footage showed Mr Gao last getting out of his car holding a large bag in Padstow. Friends of the murdered 20-year-old say 'his intention was not to be bad' and he was swayed by peer pressure . Earlier this week, MailOnline revealed details of an incident in January where Mr Gao abducted and bashed a teenager  on behalf of a scorned friend in a terrifying 90-minute ordeal. Jaiwei Yu, 19, said he was kidnapped, taken to a park and bashed in the head and chest by Mr Gao and two accomplices. Mr Gao had been called in as an enforcer to 'get revenge' on 18-year-old Alex Li on behalf of a female friend, who had been dumped by the victim's flatmate, the intended target of the assault. But when Mr Gao arrived at the flat at Carlton in Sydney's south on January 9, Mr Li was not at home – so he abducted Mr Yu instead.

Detained after dark: It was to this park, Tindale Reserve, in southern Sydney where Jamie Gao and two teenage accomplices took 19-year-old Jiawei Yu after kidnapping and beating him and driving him around in his car on the night of Thursday January 9 as part of a revenge attempt gone wrong . 'It was because Alex and his girlfriend' broke up,' Mr Yu told MailOnline at his home in Sydney's southern suburbs. '[She] wanted revenge on Alex. She used Jamie to do it ... to come around and kidnap me.' During the terrifying 90-minute ordeal Mr Yu was driven around nearby suburbs, taken to Tindale Reserve, a local park, and bashed around the head and chest by Mr Gao, who he had never previously met. 'They drove around, through the park and they beat him up with fists in the head,' Mr Li said. Meanwhile Mr Li, the intended target, was staying at a house just one street away when Mr Gao arrived sometime after 10pm. Jamie Gao's girlfriend (pictured kissing him) is in shock over his death . 'They think I am with Jaiwei. We are friends,' Mr Li said. 'They thought I would be at his house. I'm not at home and they thought he might be here.' Police interviewed Mr Yu at his home in February and on March 22 charged Mr Gao with taking and detaining Mr Yu in company with intent to get advantage and occasioning actual bodily harm. Mr Gao was also charged with conspiring with the two teenagers to assault Alex Li and cause him actual bodily harm. The girl and the third friend, who were minors at the time, will face Sutherland Children's Court on July 1 on charges relating to the kidnap and assault. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old friend of Mr Gao's, who had lunch with him the day before he was murdered, told MailOnline his involvement in a drug deal seemed completely out of character, describing him as a 'nice guy' who was swayed by peer pressure. 'People say he's dealing drugs and he's bad. But his intention is not to be bad,' she said. 'He doesn't do anything on purpose to hurt anyone, I think he was just persuaded by his friends and by peer pressure.' 'He doesn't tell us about all the stuff he does,' she said. 'He does tell us about his private life, family and girlfriend but not about the illegal stuff.' Mr Gao (left) and his girlfriend (right) started dating at the beginning of the year . The day before his murder was reportedly as normal for Mr Gao as any other. He went to his morning university classes before stopping for lunch at a nearby cafe with a uni friend. At no stage, his friend told MailOnline, did he seem nervous or on edge. Nor did he mention his plans for the following day. Instead he spent his time gushing about his new girlfriend - a young woman he'd had a crush on for some time and had been dating for just 'a couple of months'. Pictures posted to Mr Gao's girlfriend's Facebook page show the couple hugging and kissing. Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her. On Monday May 19, the UTS business student went to class in the morning and afternoon as normal. During a break between 11am and 1pm he lunched with a friend at Caffe Tiamo on Pitt St in Sydney's CBD. Mr Gao's girlfriend told the MailOnline it was a 'very hard time' for her . His female friend, who did not want to be named, said Mr Gao did not talk about his plans for the next day. 'He was fine, normal. we had lunch,' she said. 'He didn't tell me about the meeting.' Mr Gao's friend told MailOnline that, before the body was formally identified, his girlfriend was still hopeful he'd return, saying she 'still expects him to come back'. 'They've only officially been together a couple of months, but he liked her for a while,' she said. The friend described Mr Gao as social and naturally smart. 'He wasn't crazy about study, he wasn't the nerdy type that studies every day, he was more social,' she said. Mr Gao's body was found floating off Sydney's Shelly Beach, near Cronulla, wrapped in a blue tarp on Monday morning. The discovery triggered a nation-wide manhunt for Rogerson, which ended in his arrest in a blaze of publicity at his Sydney home. McNamara, a former police colleague of Rogerson's, was charged with Mr Gao's murder on Sunday night. A body found floating off Shelly Beach near Cronulla was formally identified as Mr Gao on Tuesday afternoon . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n",
            "ia's government has pushed the country into an economic crisis by not tackling its financial problems fast enough, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin has said . Russia's government has pushed the country into an economic crisis by not tackling its financial problems fast enough, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin has said. His comments came as the central bank bailed out its first victim of the collapsing currency and authorities announced a tax on grain exports to protect domestic stocks. A poll of 11 economists also predicted that Russia's gross domestic product would fall 3.6 per cent next year. Russia has been hit by what Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev recently called a 'perfect storm' of plummeting oil prices, sanctions related to its military action in Ukraine, and a flight of investors' capital. A lack of structural reforms has compounded the problem, making the economy overwhelmingly dependent on oil revenues. Kudrin, one of few to criticise President Vladimir Putin, said he believed the decline in the rouble could be attributed primarily to the sanctions, imposed following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and its subsequent support for loyalist fighters in the east. In a move to contain the ruble crisis, the government today instructed five of the country's biggest state-controlled exporters to reduce their foreign currency assets to October levels and to not raise them again until March. The companies targeted were gas giant Gazprom, oil companies Rosneft and Zarubezhneft and diamond producers Alrosa and Kristall. Today the ruble was steady as it has been for the past few trading sessions, floating around the 55 mark against the dollar. That's certainly an improvement on last week when the ruble plunged at one point to near 80 against the dollar. With retailers, particularly of imported products, looking to pass costs onto consumers in light of the ruble's fall, jittery consumers rushed to buy cars and emptied shelves at electronics and home appliances stores to pre-empt the price rises. Others besieged bank offices to withdraw their deposits and buy dollars or euros - the panic that raised the threat of a full-fledged banking crisis if it's not contained quickly. In response to the falling ruble, Russia's central bank last week increased its key interest rate to a whopping 17 per cent. Though that may help ease the selling pressure on the ruble by encouraging traders to hold onto the currency in anticipation of big returns, it is going to hobble Russian businesses and households. Scroll down for video . Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia's current economic difficulties were exacerbated by Western sanctions, 'There are hopes to turn Russia into a pariah and reduce it to lower ranks in the ratings. This will never happen.' Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev promised that the interest rate will be reduced once the ruble stabilizes, but acknowledged that the country faces the risk of a 'deep recession.' Medvedev said Russia's current economic difficulties were exacerbated by Western sanctions. He said the economy is in a worse place now than in the 2008 crisis because 'a number of countries are effectively hampering the development of our economy.' He said: 'There are hopes to turn Russia into a pariah and reduce it to lower ranks in the ratings. This will never happen.' Putin discussed the Ukraine crisis with the leaders of Germany, France and Ukraine by telephone yesterday, the Kremlin said, noting that a ceasefire had largely held in eastern Ukraine in recent days. It said the leaders had emphasised the importance of removing heavy weapons and exchanging prisoners, but gave no indication of whether a breakthrough had been reached. Government officials have tried to minimise the impact of sanctions on the country and its currency, which plunged 80 per cent against the dollar last week despite a hike in interest rates to 17 per cent. Putin has claimed 'external factors' like oil were the key factor behind the country's 'tough times'. Kudrin warned that Russia risked having its debt downgraded to junk status in 2015. He said: 'We have entered or are entering a real, full-fledged economic crisis. Next year we will feel it clearly. Putin, seen above during a Russian press conference last week, discussed the Ukraine crisis with the leaders of Germany, France and Ukraine by telephone yesterday, the Kremlin said. It said the leaders had emphasised the importance of removing heavy weapons and exchanging prisoners, but gave no indication of whether a breakthrough had been reached. 'The government has not been quick enough to address the situation ... I am yet to hear ... its clear assessment of the current situation.' Kudrin quit in 2011 in protest at proposals to increase defence spending, although he and Putin are still believed to be close. Mounting evidence suggested that Russia's economic pain and isolation were starting to bite. The country announced plans to impose a heavy tax on grain exports since rouble volatility and high global prices have caused exports to spike: . And Russia's central bank said it would have to bail out mid-sized Trust Bank with 30 billion roubles (£347 million) to stop it going bankrupt. The country's largest lender Sberbank was forced to deny a report from RIA news agency that it had suspended taking new requests for auto loans and mortgages. Though Russia's biggest oil firm Rosneft partially eased some worries by saying it had made a £4.5 billion debt repayment from its own cash reserves - investors had been concerned it could default because the sanctions cut off its access to Western finance. It announced separately that a deal to acquire an oil trading business from Morgan Stanley had been terminated due to a refusal by regulators in the U.S. to clear it. Russia has been hit by what Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev recently called a 'perfect storm' of plummeting oil prices, sanctions related to its military action in Ukraine, and a flight of investors' capital. A lack of structural reforms has compounded the problem, making the economy overwhelmingly dependent on oil revenues . The termination of the deal is another blow for Rosneft after its partners including ExxonMobil withdrew from projects to develop Arctic offshore oil deposits after the sanctions were introduced. Kudrin forecast a series of defaults among both medium and large companies, though he said banks would probably be supported by the state which was likely to result in rating agencies downgrading Russia's debt to 'junk' status. The rouble firmed against the dollar yesterday, with exporters responding to Putin's urge to sell their foreign currency revenues on the market, and Brent crude prices stood close to £38 a barrel. While the currency, down some 45 per cent against the dollar so far this year, may stabilise in the first quarter of next year, its decline will likely help to push inflation to a rate of 12-15 per cent in 2015, Kudrin said. The central bank envisages next year's inflation at around 8 per cent. Economists have predicted it would be as high as 9.2 percent. Kudrin said he believed that between 25 and 35 per cent of the decline in the rouble could be attributed to sanctions. The rest, he said, was down to a stronger dollar and investors' mistrust of Russian authorities and their actions. His outlook for the economy next year was bleak: Even if the price of oil rose to £51 per barrel, gross domestic product was still likely to fall by more than 2 per cent in 2015, Kudrin said. At £38 per barrel GDP would decline by 4 per cent or more, he added, echoing the central bank's latest assessment, published last week.\n",

The son-in-law of a Monaco heiress shot dead as she left a hospital has withdrawn his confession to the killing, saying he did not understand 'all the nuances' of the French language. Wojciech Janowski, 64, last week confessed to playing a role in the shooting of Helene Pastor, the 77-year-old billionaire mother of his partner Sylvia Pastor, according to prosecutors. However, as Janowski appeared before a bail judge, his lawyer Erick Campana said that he had 'retracted his statements made while in custody' and 'denies having ordered' the killing. Withdrawn: Wojciech Janowski, 64, (left) has withdrawn his confession to killing Helene Pastor, 77, (right) saying he did not understand 'all the nuances' of the French language . Mr Campana said Janowski, who has served as Poland's honorary consul in Monaco, had 'misunderstood the meanings of the terms used by police and was speaking in French while he does not understand all the nuances of our language'. Mr Campana said he would demand that an appeal court nullify Janowski's detention - and the statements made while in custody - because he did not have access to a lawyer or interpreter during his 96 hours in custody. However, the judge ruled that Cambridge graduate Janowski must remain in custody pending trial. Janowski was arrested early last week by police on suspicion of 'masterminding' the killing of Mrs Pastor, who was shot multiple times with a sawn-off shotgun as she was leaving a hospital in the French Riviera city of Nice. Her driver, Mohammed Darwich, 64, also died from injuries sustained in attack on May 6. Probe: A police officer investigates a car at the site where Helene Pastor and her driver were shot . Questioned: Wojciech Janowski, hides his face as he leaves a police station in Nice, France, by car last week . Janowski was charged after prosecutors said he confessed to the contract killing, for which he allegedly spent some 250,000 euros (£198,000) to hire two alleged contract killers. The two men - a 31-year-old and a 24-year-old originally from the Comoros islands and living in Marseille's rough northern districts - were also apprehended last week and charged. Janowski's personal trainer was also charged with allegedly organising the murder and acting as a go-between with the killers. Prosecutors had alleged Janowski ordered the killing 'to lay his hands on the inheritance' due to Sylvia, Pastor's eldest daughter on her death. Sylvia was initially detained in the case but later released without charge. The two have been in a relationship for 28 years and have a teenage daughter. Couple: Janowski and Sylvia Pastor (right) have been in a relationship for 28 years and have a teenage daughter . Helene Pastor had inherited a huge real estate and construction business set up by her Italian grandfather Jean-Baptiste Pastor, a stone mason who moved to Monaco in 1880. As the sleepy principality on the French Riviera slowly grew into a playground for the world's rich and famous, the family's fortune skyrocketed. The real jackpot came in 1966 when Prince Rainier, whose fairytale wedding to Hollywood actress Grace Kelly helped catapult Monaco to international fame, gave permission to Helene Pastor's father Gildo to build high-rise buildings along the seafront. Janowski heads a Monaco nanotechnology firm and an oil business, and is involved in numerous charities in the principality. After he was charged, Poland announced it was stripping Janowski of his title of honorary consul 'because of the loss of the irreproachable reputation that is essential for this role'. It also noted that as an honorary official Janowski did not enjoy diplomatic immunity from criminal prosecution.\n",

Nearly 300 police officers searched for Bourque, who was seen going in and out of a wooded area. RCMP Supt. Marlene Snowman said Bourque was arrested at 12:10 a.m. She said he wasn't carrying any weapons, but some were found nearby. Prosecutors and police declined to comment when asked if the guns were acquired legally. Bourque turned himself over without incident. Bearded and shaggy-haired, Bourque made a brief court appearance Friday afternoon, where he was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. In aqua-colored jail clothes, he stared ahead intently, clearly paying attention but showing little emotion. He nodded when the judge said his name. He will be back in court July 3 as he seeks a lawyer. A court appointed legal aid attorney represented him Friday. Prosecutors say they were not requesting a psychiatric evaluation, seeing no need for one. The defence agreed. There was a high-level security at the appearance, including officers with drawn weapons outside the courtroom. Two other officers - Constables Éric Stéphane Dubois and Marie Darlene Goguen - were injured in the shootings and rushed to a local hospital for surgery but neither condition was life-threatening.\n",

Soldiers swooped on a home just after midnight in the West Bank city of Hebron, where Israeli forces have concentrated their search for the killers. The arrest came after protests over the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian teenager spread yesterday from Jerusalem to Arab towns in northern Israel. Scroll down for video .

The Israeli Defence Force would not elaborate on the arrest . An American teenager - the cousin of the murdered Palestinian boy - who was beaten and detained by police during the protests in east Jerusalem was today brought before an Israeli court. Overnight, Israeli airstrikes targeted what the Israelis claimed were rocket launchers and a weapons workshop in the Gaza Strip, after 29 rockets and mortars were fired into Israeli territory. Relations between Israel and Palestine have been tense since Eyal Yifrach, 19, and 16-year-olds Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frenkel were abducted on June 12, leading to a massive Israeli military operation in Palestinian areas. They were later found dead in a shallow grave, a discovery quickly followed by the the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian boy, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, who was snatched from his home in East Jerusalem. His burned body was found in a forest. Palestinian officials said a post-mortem indicated the 16-year old had been burned alive.

Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said police had arrested 22 Israeli Arabs. Unlike Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli Arabs hold citizenship rights, but still face discrimination from the 'Jewish State'.

He was detained along with six other protesters, police said, including some armed with knives, adding that several officers were hurt in that specific protest, one of many that day. Amateur video of what Tariq's father Salah said was the beating aired on a local television station, and he said he could recognize his son from his clothing.

            ") -- When I became one of Bill Clinton's earliest and chief accusers for the sexual harassment charges against him, two things were eminently true about my motives: (a) I did not become an accuser because Bill Clinton was a Democrat and I was a Republican, I didn't care one whit what the partisan fallout would be; and (b) I spoke out because the charges were plentiful enough and serious enough (I repeat, charges, not facts) to degrade not only all of our politics but all of our country, and because there are certain codes of honor, written and unwritten, for all men, Democrat and Republican. Indeed I wrote a book on this, laying it out, even before we knew the full extent of Bill Clinton's lies. It is hypocritical in the extreme for those members of the media who didn't take the charges and allegations against Bill Clinton seriously to be taking the allegations against Herman Cain that we now have as seriously as they are. Hypocritical is probably too soft a word, frankly. That said, Herman Cain and his campaign chief of staff, Mark Block, cannot go on as they have. There has been a pattern now that is both unhealthy for our politics and unhealthy for our polity. Four women are not an insignificant number. One or two anonymous charges, perhaps. Three anonymous charges (where, as I understand the story, Cain knows of at least two of the women) plus one woman who went very public and opened herself up to all manner of investigation are a lot. It is no longer insignificant. Neither is it insignificant that the Cain campaign discounted the charges in the initial stories, saying they were based on anonymous sources, only to make a mockery by blaming other campaigns with less substantiation than the original stories. If Herman Cain wants to be taken seriously as a public advocate for anything, never mind running for the chief executive and commander in chief of the most powerful and important and blessed country in the world, he needs to give a full press conference dedicated exclusively to this issue and these allegations. I have watched long enough and held my tongue long enough to give him the benefit of the doubt, but can no longer say this is a witch hunt, \"a lynching\" to use his word, or any other euphemism. There are allegations out there that matter and they have stacked up. For we who led the charge against Bill Clinton on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply doesn't matter makes us the hypocrites as well. As I say, all of this is bad for our politics and polity. If Herman Cain cannot stand up to these charges, if he refuses to, then he should step out of the race. A man big enough to run for president should be big enough to have a full and candid press conference on all of this -- he wants us to elect him president after all, he's asking us to trust our lives and the country's life to him. This could be one of his finest moments and it could be one of his worst. But either way, he must confront the moment candidly and manfully. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.\n"
