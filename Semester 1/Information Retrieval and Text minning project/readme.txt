ABSTRACT:
Pre-processing is preliminary stage in several fields counting IR and natural language
processing. The outcome of basic pre-processing settings on English for matter content summarization is
well studied. However, there is no such effort found for the Urdu language (with the quality of knowledge).
In this study, we investigate the effect of basic pre-processing settings for single-document text summarizing
for Urdu, on a target corpus using several trials. The analysis is performed using the state of the art
algorithms for extractive summarizing and the effect of stop word removal, lemmatizing, and stemming
is analyzed. Results showed that these pre-processing settings develop the effects.
